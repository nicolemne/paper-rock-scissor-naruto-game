# PAPER ROCK SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK - NARUTO STYLE

more text here 

Originally I wanted to create a Tic-Tac-Toe website, but in the end I decided to go for a Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock game instead. Because I had already started working on the Tic-Tac-Toe site I re-used the structure for HTML and CSS from there, to this website, to save a little bit of time.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

### User Stories

Add your user stories here. You want to include first time visitors and returning visitors here as a minimum. Think about each group, and the experience and journey you want them to have on your site. It really helps to think about this before you start coding, and will really help with creating your wireframes.

## Design

### Finished site
![Website](assets/readme/pp2-website.jpg)

### Colour Scheme

I decided to go with colours that represent Naruto, and the best way to generate them was to take samples from the [Naruto's Official Website.](https://naruto-official.com/en)

![Swatches](assets/readme/color-palette%20(1).png)

### Typography

I've picked the font 'Mogra' from Google Fonts, which I think has a close resemblance to the Naruto-font that is used in the Anime series and Manga. Mogra is used on all text on this website.

![Typography](assets/readme/google-font.png)

### Imagery

I wanted to have a background image with Naruto (The main character of the Manga and Anime series 'Naruto'). I had to cut out the emblem displayed inside the original image using Paint, to have a full black background to have the elements on top of. 

### Original Background Image
![Original](assets/readme/naruto-original.jpg)

### Cropped Background Image

### Button Images
The button images were borrrowed from a Naruto fan wiki-website, and in order to hide the white I decided to display the images with round buttons and borders

![wind](assets/readme/wind.png)
![earth](assets/readme/earth.png)
![lightning](assets/readme/lightning.png)

### Wireframes

The wireframes was created using Balsamiq. I wanted to have a simple layout with the game buttons centered in the middle of the page, and the scores and reset button close to the center for easy view. The "How to Play" button is a little bit more discrete and I chose to have it in the upper left corner. 

![Wireframes](../project-portfolio-2/assets/readme/wireframes.png)

## Features

My website consists of only one page, and features the following: 

## How to Play button that displays an alert
![How-to-play](assets/readme/help-button.png)

![Alert](assets/readme/alert.png)

### When you enter the website the first text will be a short line describing the game
![Starting-game](assets/readme/header-text-1.png)

### 5 buttons to play
![Game-buttons](assets/readme/buttons-color.png)

### When you win a game, the text displays your win
![Win](assets/readme/header-text-2.png)

### Or, when you lose a game
![Lose](assets/readme/header-text-3.png)

### The text also changes when you reset your score and start a new game
![New-game](assets/readme/header-text-4.png)

### The website has a score area to keep track of your and computer wins
![Scores](assets/readme/score-section.png)

### A button to reset your and the computer score
![Scores](assets/readme/reset-score.png)

### Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn
![Scores](assets/readme/links.png)

### Finished site
![Website](assets/readme/pp2-website.jpg)

### Future Implementations

I would like to add more code that works with the Local Storage, so that a scorearea will be displayed where you can keep track of your wins. If this was implemented, I would also add a function that tracks how many rounds you've played, and ends the game after a certain amount of runs.

### Accessibility

I have tried my best to be mindful of accessibility, and the steps I've taken for this are the following:

- Aria labels to the social media links
- Chose a good colour contrast throughout the website
- Semantic HTML
