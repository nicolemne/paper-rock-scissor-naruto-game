# PAPER ROCK SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK - NARUTO STYLE

Naruto - Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock, is a simple, but an extended version of Rock, Paper, Scissor. Much like the name suggests, it is just like the Rock, Paper, Scissor with the addition of Lizard and Spock, but all names have been exchanged to Water, Fire, Wind, Earth and Lightning. 

The game is played by clicking one of the buttons in the middle of the page, the computer will then pick a choice for itself, and a result will be displayed. You can either win, tie or lose a round. The scores will be shown in the scoring area below the buttons. The game will continue for as long as the user chooses to.

Originally I wanted to create a Tic-Tac-Toe website, but in the end, I decided to go for a Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock game instead. Because I had already started working on the Tic-Tac-Toe site I re-used the structure for HTML and CSS from there, to this website, to save a little bit of time.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### Client goals visitors

To be able to view the site and play the game on a range of device sizes.

#### First-time visitors 

I would like a first-time visitor to be curious to test out the game and hopefully have a good time doing so. I'd like to think that a first-time visitor would think that the design and colour scheme is sleek and fun, especially if the visitor is a fan of the Naruto manga or anime series. My goal here is also for the user to enjoy a simple game with a Naruto design and gameplay, and perhaps even recommend it to a friend.

#### Returning visitors 

I hope that the first-time user will enjoy the game enough to want to return and play again. 

## Design

### Finished site
![Website](assets/readme/pp2-website.jpg)

### Colour Scheme

I decided to go with colours that represent Naruto, and the best way to generate them was to take samples from the [Naruto's Official Website.](https://naruto-official.com/en)

![Swatches](assets/readme/color-palette%20(1).png)

### Typography

I've picked the font 'Mogra' from Google Fonts, which I think has a close resemblance to the Naruto font that is used in the Anime series and Manga. Mogra is used on all text on this website.

![Typography](assets/readme/google-font.png)

### Imagery

I wanted to have a background image with Naruto (The main character of the Manga and Anime series 'Naruto'). I had to cut out the emblem displayed inside the original image using Paint, to have a full black background to have the elements on top of. 

#### Original Background Image
![Original](assets/readme/naruto-original.jpg)

#### Cropped Background Image
![Cropped](assets/images/naruto.png)

#### Button Images
The button images were borrowed from a Naruto fan wiki website, and to hide the white I decided to display the images with round buttons and borders

![wind](assets/readme/wind.png)
![earth](assets/readme/earth.png)
![lightning](assets/readme/lightning.png)

### Wireframes

The wireframes were created using Balsamiq. I wanted to have a simple layout with the game buttons centred in the middle of the page, and the scores and reset button close to the centre for easy view. The "How to Play" button is a little bit more discrete and I chose to have it in the upper left corner. 

![Wireframes](assets/readme/wireframes.png)

## Features

My website consists of only one page, and features the following: 

### How to Play button that displays an alert
![How-to-play](assets/readme/help-button.png)

![Alert](assets/readme/alert.png)

#### When you enter the website the first text will be a short line describing the game
![Starting-game](assets/readme/header-text-1.png)

#### 5 buttons to play
![Game-buttons](assets/readme/buttons-color.png)

#### When you win a game, the text displays your win
![Win](assets/readme/header-text-2.png)

#### Or, when you lose a game
![Lose](assets/readme/header-text-3.png)

#### The text also changes when you reset your score and start a new game
![New-game](assets/readme/header-text-4.png)

#### The website has a score area to keep track of your and your computer's wins
![Scores](assets/readme/score-section.png)

#### A button to reset your and the computer's score
![Scores](assets/readme/reset-score.png)

#### Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn
![Scores](assets/readme/links.png)

#### Finished site
![Website](assets/readme/pp2-website.jpg)

### Future Implementations

I would like to add more code that works with the Local Storage so that a score area will be displayed where you can keep track of your wins. If this was implemented, I would also add a function that tracks how many rounds you've played, and ends the game after a certain amount of runs.

### Accessibility

I have tried my best to be mindful of accessibility, and the steps I've taken for this are the following:

- Aria labels to the social media links
- Chose a good colour contrast throughout the website
- Semantic HTML
